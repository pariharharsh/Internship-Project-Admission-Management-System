# Internship-Project-Admission-Management-System
Admission Management System with Data Analytics

This project was developed to design and analyze an Admission Management System using MySQL for database design and Power BI for visualization. The objective was to manage admission records efficiently and present valuable insights through dashboards.

The process began with database design in MySQL, where tables were created for applicants, courses, admissions, and results. Proper relationships were established using primary and foreign keys, and normalization ensured efficiency and accuracy.

Next, the data was fetched and modeled using SQL queries. Operations such as filtering, joining, and aggregations prepared clean datasets, which were then imported into Power BI.

In Power BI, two dashboards were created:

Applicant Dashboard

Application submitted status

Document verification progress

Registration fee payment status

Test completion and appearance details

Result declaration updates

Admin Dashboard (KPIs)

Application Received vs Target Applications

Result details: Test name, marks, and rank

Qualified vs Not Qualified for admission

Application funnel: Submitted → Documents Verified → Payment Status → Test Appeared → Result Declared → Admission Confirmed

The dashboards used KPIs, charts, and slicers to provide clear insights and interactive navigation. For example, admission progress could be tracked from submission to final selection, while results could be analyzed by marks, ranks, and qualification status.

Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented a normalized relational database in MySQL.

Performed data fetching, cleaning, and modeling using SQL queries.

Developed Applicant and Admin dashboards in Power BI with relevant KPIs.

Outcome:

The project integrated database design, SQL handling, and business intelligence tools into one solution. It offered a transparent way to track admissions, enabling applicants to view their status and administrators to monitor progress against targets.
